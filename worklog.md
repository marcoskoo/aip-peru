Task ID: 2
Agent: Seed Script Agent
Task: Create AIP seed script with real data from official AIP PERÚ publications

Work Log:
- Examined existing schema (Airway, AirwaySegment, Waypoint, Navaid, AirspaceRestriction models)
- Examined existing seed scripts (seed-routes.ts had fake airways like W50, W86, W10, etc.)
- Created /home/z/my-project/prisma/seed-aip-data.ts with comprehensive real data
- Implemented coordinate parser for AIP format (e.g. `02°25'05"S`)
- Step 1: Deleted ALL existing airways (46) and segments (159) to avoid duplicates
- Step 2: Upserted 31 navaids from ENR 4.1 with real frequencies, channels, coordinates, elevations
- Step 3: Upserted 180 waypoints from ENR 4.4 (including navaid-referenced waypoints)
- Step 4: Created 23 airways with 103 segments from ENR 3.1/3.2/3.3:
  - ENR 3.1 (Lower Conventional): A301, A304, A566, A568, A573, B552, G675, R567, V1, V2, V3 (11 airways)
  - ENR 3.2 (Upper Conventional): UV1, UV3, UV4, UV5, UV9, UV10, UV11 (7 airways)
  - ENR 3.3 (RNAV Lower): L302, L525, T216, T218, T226 (5 airways)
- Step 5: Upserted 17 airspace restrictions from ENR 5.1 (SPP01-SPP89)
- Each segment includes all new fields: magneticTrack, reverseMagneticTrack, classification, widthNM, upperLimit, lowerLimit, minEnrouteAltitude, remarks
- Script is idempotent: uses upsert for navaids/waypoints/restrictions, delete+recreate for airways
- Ran script successfully and verified counts

Stage Summary:
- Replaced 46 fake airways (159 segments) with 23 real AIP airways (103 segments)
- 31 real navaids from ENR 4.1 (AND, OAS, AQP, ARI, POY, CLA, BTE, ZCO, ILO, IQT, JCL, JUL, LPA, LET, MLV, SCO, URA, PZA, PUL, PLG, PDO, SLS, SRV, UAS, TCA, TAL, TAP, TRO, TRU, BES, URC)
- 180 waypoints from ENR 4.4 (including 5-letter waypoints and navaid references)
- 17 real airspace restrictions from ENR 5.1 (7 Prohibited, 5 Restricted, 3 Danger, 2 Restricted-ARC)
- Full magnetic track data, airspace classification, route width, and operational remarks preserved

Task: Add Aerodrome Selector to NOTAMs, Weather Panel, and Aeronautical Calculator

Work Log:
- Read existing codebase: page.tsx, notam-listing.tsx, weather-panel.tsx, aeronautical-calculator.tsx, API routes
- Created reusable AerodromeSelector component at /src/components/aerodrome-selector.tsx

  - Filters NOTAMs by airportId when an aerodrome is selected
  - Shows selected aerodrome badge in the auto-refresh indicator
  - Added "Filtrar por aeródromo" placeholder text
- Updated WeatherPanel component
  - Added showSelector prop (default false)
  - When showSelector=true, shows AerodromeSelector at the top

- Updated AeronauticalCalculator component
  - Replaced internal AirportSelector with new AerodromeSelector
  - Added AerodromeSelector in the calculator header
  - When an aerodrome is selected, shows compact info badge (ICAO, name, elevation, coordinates)
